# IoT Network Protocol Analysis

Network traffic analysis lab using Wireshark to capture, dissect, and validate 
secure IoT communication protocols across a full CDA-GDA-Cloud architecture.

## 📁 Analysis Coverage

| Protocol | What Was Captured |
|----------|------------------|
| MQTT | All 14 control packet types including CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE |
| TLS/SSL | Full handshake sequence and certificate exchange |
| TCP/IP | Connection establishment, data transfer, teardown |
| CoAP | Constrained device request/response patterns |

## 🔧 Technologies Used
`Wireshark` `MQTT` `TLS/SSL` `TCP/IP` `CoAP`

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Deep packet inspection and protocol dissection
- Validating end-to-end encrypted IoT communication
- Network traffic analysis for security verification
- IoT protocol behavior across constrained and gateway devices
